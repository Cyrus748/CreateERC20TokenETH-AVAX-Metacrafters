# CreateERC20TokenETH-AVAX-Metacrafters
Sure, here's a detailed `README.md` file for your GitHub project that explains how to create an ERC20 token using your Solidity contract.

# Creating an ERC20 Token

This project demonstrates how to create a basic ERC20 token using Solidity. The ERC20 standard is a widely adopted token standard that defines functionalities for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Structure

- **SimpleToken.sol**: This Solidity file contains the implementation of the ERC20 token contract.
  
## ERC20 Token Contract

The ERC20 token contract is implemented in `SimpleToken.sol`. Here's a breakdown of the contract:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract SimpleToken is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("AdityaToken", "ADT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 100 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

- `pragma solidity ^0.8.9;`: Specifies that the contract is compatible with Solidity version 0.8.9 and above.
- `import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";`: Imports the ERC20 implementation from the OpenZeppelin library.
- `contract SimpleToken is ERC20 { ... }`: Defines a new contract `SimpleToken` that inherits from `ERC20`.

#### Constructor:

- `constructor() ERC20("AdityaToken", "ADT") { ... }`: Constructor function that initializes the ERC20 token with the name "AdityaToken" and the symbol "ADT".

#### `_mint` Function:

- `_mint(msg.sender, 100 * 10 ** decimals());`: Mints 100 tokens to the deployer's address (`msg.sender`) upon deployment. Adjust the number based on your tokenomics.

## Usage

To deploy and interact with the ERC20 token:

1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
   - Install necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

2. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Use a development environment like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.
   - Compile and deploy `SimpleToken.sol`.
   
3. **Interact with the Token**:
   - Once deployed, you can use tools like Remix IDE, MetaMask, or write a script in web3.js/ethers.js to interact with the deployed token.
